### Talk Python Search API app

A very simple search app using Talk Python's search API. I'm sure there's a more elegant 
solution to the logic, but it works. And it checks for value errors, which makes me happy.

More importantly, it uses the same structure as my other search app, which means I can reuse 
this basic structure going forward. Not bad. #100DaysOfCode Day 42 :)
