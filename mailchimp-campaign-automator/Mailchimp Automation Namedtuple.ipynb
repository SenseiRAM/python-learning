    "*Please note: This was written for a custom coded Mailchimp template. The script is custom built for this very specific template. It's probably not going to do anyone else any good, but it was a good learning exercise. Furthermore, the _only_ thing this script does is fill in text for a campaign. I still have to manually find images, add the headline and intro text for the email, etc. It saves me a lot of time every week and was worth every hair-pulling moment :)*\n",

    "One last thing, you will need a webdriver in the same directory as your script to make this work. I used the Chrome driver, which can be found here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the first block of code to login to Mailchimp. When the campaign is loaded, be sure to manually move the divider widget and scroll to the bottom of the template. This compensates for a Mailchimp frame sizing bug."
