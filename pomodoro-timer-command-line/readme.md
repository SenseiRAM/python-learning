# Simple Command Line Pomodoro Timer

Like the sign says, this is just a Pomodoro timer ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)!). Honestly, it's really just a "timer," since it's not limited to 25 minutes with 5 minute breaks.

It will ask how many minutes you wish to focus, after which it will beep three times. It will then ask if you wish to set another timer. Enter any key other than 'y' to close the program.

This was a very simple project put together for 100 Days of Code. I'm a little surprised, but I actually find myself using it every day, since it just runs without me having to look at it or think about it. Added bonus, I don't have to use my phone as a timer, which comes with all kinds of notification distractions.
