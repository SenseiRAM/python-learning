# Simple data analysis with Ordered Dictionaries, Named Tuples and Counter
A script that imports data from program/job applicants and factors most common data points.
As is, it figures out the most common city from which people are applying.
A more robust version would allow the user to choose which stats to count, or even count them all
and prepare a report.

Ideally, it would be better to define functions, etc. I would also like to parse
the specific dates out of the submission dates, so the user could easily find the most
common submission date.

This script was created as part of 100 Days of Code, and aimed specifically
at learning how to work with ordered dictionaries and named tuples.
