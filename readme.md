# My first Readme!

Not sure how this will turn out, but trying to get in the habit of using source control. This code is full of problems and it's about as unperfect as it could be, but it has already streamlined a lot of my day to day work, and I'm proud of that. I still need to add documentation, commenting, and of course, do lots of refactoring, but I need to get in the habit of sharing my work :)

Hopefully just the start of much more to come.
