# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A vey simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Made for Talk Python's [100 Days of Code course][https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_in_python/100-days-of-code-in-python].

The player inputs their name and then selects rock, paper, or scissors and sees how they do against the computer. There are while loops in place to ensure that inputs are correct, and to see if the player wishes to play again. I also imported the time module to add a little dramatic pause between throws and make the game more interesting. It's not as fun when the computer just spits out all the results in a big blob of text. Much more fun to have a little anticipation between button presses and the results!

I guess technically there's even a little recursion in here, as the game loop calls itself if you choose to play again.
